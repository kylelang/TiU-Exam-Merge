1. Do we want to process the exam name and/or course code from TestVision?
-- 2020-12-11: No

2. Do we want/need the ability to process multiple Canvas/TestVision exams?
-- 2020-12-11: Gido is checking

3. What do we use as the "Course Name", "Course Code", and "Exam Date" entries
   in the irregularity checks output? We have a (potentially) different version
   of each.

4. How do we want to format the output of the irregularity checks? Two-row heading?
